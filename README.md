### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Felix, a passionate learner with an unquenchable curiosity and a strong desire for knowledge. I have always been fascinated by the application of data science in fields such as health care, e-commerce, and technology. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's in Business Analytics at UCLA Anderson.

In the past, I have gained valuable experience working as an e-commerce and marketing data analyst intern at LivingSpace Interiors. Additionally, I served as a research assistant, collaborating with professors in the quantitative marketing field at my undergraduate institution. These business-focused projects have allowed me to showcase my meticulous attention to detail, as I defined various metrics to effectively monitor the performance of diverse products.
