### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As someone who holds an insatiable willingness to learn, bearing a sense of curiosity that branches towards a thirst for knowledge, I have always been intrigued by the process of data science within the realm of health care, E-commerce, and tech. At the moment, I am pursuing my Masters in Business Analytics at UCLA Anderson. In the past, I have worked in LivingSpace Interiors, as an E-commerce and marketing data analyst intern; I have also been a research assistant, working alongside professors within the quantitative marketing field from my undergraduate university. The business-oriented projects I have conducted previously allowed me to demonstrate my tendency to pay attention to details, defining different metrics, thereby allowing me to monitor the health of various products.
